# F.A.Q.
* What is Nemean? : The Nemean (/nɪˈmiːən/;) was a vicious lion monster in Greek mythology that lived at Nemea. It could
 not be killed with mortal's weapons because its golden fur was impervious to attack. Its claws were sharper than 
 mortal's swords and could cut through any armor. 
 
 * Why another coming soon template library? : My first coming soon template [Metis](https://gitlab.com/daksh7011/metis) 
 has complex structure and has many animation based operations. [Nemean](https://gitlab.com/daksh7011/) is being 
 developed for those people who don't want anything fancy like [Metis](https://gitlab.com/daksh7011/metis) but 
 want a flat and minimalist taste.
